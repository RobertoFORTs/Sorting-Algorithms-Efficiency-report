# Sorting-Algorithms-Efficiency-report
A program used for testing algorithms efficiency

For this simple work, you only got to have a c compiler to compile and then execute the program.
If you use gcc, you can type:
```gcc -o prg main.cpp sorting.cpp```
followed by:
```./prg```

The entries to run the program will be the starting size of the array, followed by the final size, the range between th size in each test, and the number of tests(repetitions) you wanna do with the "n"-sized array.
